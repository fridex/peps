Abstract
========

This PEP describes a way to record provenance of Python distributions
installed.  The record is created by an installer and is available to users in
a form of a JSON file ``provenance_url.json`` in ``.dist-info`` directory. The
mentioned JSON file captures additional metadata to allow recording a URL to a
Python distribution together with the installed Python distribution hash. This
proposal is built on top of :pep:`610` following `its corresponding canonical
PyPA spec
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/direct-url/>`__ and
complements ``direct_url.json`` with ``provenance_url.json`` file when packages
are identified by a name, and either a version.

Motivation
==========

Installing a Python package involves downloading a distribution from an index
and extracting its content to an appropriate place. After the installation
process is done, information about the distribution used as well as its source
is generally lost. Nevertheless, there are use cases for keeping records of
distributions used for installing packages and their provenance.

Python wheels can be built with different compiler flags or supporting
different wheel tags.  In both cases, users might get into a situation in which
multiple wheels might be considered by installers (possibly from different
package indexes) and immediately finding out which wheel file was actually used
during the installation might be helpful. This way, developers can use
information about wheels to debug issues making sure the desired wheel was
actually installed. Another use case could be tools reporting software
installed, such as tools reporting SBOM (Software Bill of Material), that might
give more accurate reports. Yet another use case could be reconstruction of the
Python environment by pinning each installed package to specific distribution
consumed from a Python packagee index.

The motivation described in this PEP is an extension to :pep:`610`.  Besides
stating information about packages installed using a direct URL, installers SHOULD
record information also for packages installed from Python package indexes when
identified by their name, and optionally their version.

Specification
=============

The ``provenance_url.json`` file SHOULD be created in the ``*.dist-info``
directory by installers when installing a distribution identified by their
name, and optionally their version specifier.

This file MUST NOT be created when installing a distribution from a requirement
specifying a direct URL reference (including a VCS URL).

Only one of ``provenance_url.json`` and ``direct_url.json`` from :pep:`610`
files MAY be present in ``*.dist-info`` directory.

The ``provenance_url.json`` JSON file MUST be a dictionary, compliant with
:rfc:`8259` and UTF-8 encoded.

If present, it MUST contain exactly two keys. The first one is ``url``, with
type ``string``.  The second key MUST be ``archive_info`` with a value defined
below.

The ``url`` field MUST state a URL to the installed distribution. If a wheel is
built from a source distribution, the ``url`` field MUST point to the used
source distribution. On the other hand, when a wheel is installed, the
``url`` field MUST keep a URL of the installed wheel. Following :pep:`610`, the
``url`` field MUST be stripped of any sensitive authentication information, for
security reasons.

The user:password section of the URL MAY however be composed of environment
variables, matching the following regular expression::

    \$\{[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\}(:\$\{[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\})?

Additionally, the user:password section of the URL MAY be a well-known,
non-security sensitive string. A typical example is ``git`` in the case of an
URL such as ``ssh://git@gitlab.com``.

The value of ``archive_info`` MUST be a dictionary with a single key
``hashes``.  The ``hashes`` key is a dictionary mapping a hash name to a
hex-encoded digest of the file referenced by the ``url`` field. Multiple hashes
can be included, and it is up to the consumer to decide what to do with
multiple hashes (it may validate all of them or a subset of them, or nothing at
all).

Each hash MUST be one of the single argument hashes provided by
``hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed`` except for ``sha1`` and ``md5`` hashes. At
the time of writing this PEP, the listing does not include multi-argument
hashes ``shake_128`` and ``shake_256``:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import hashlib
  >>> sorted(hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed - {"shake_128", "shake_256", "sha1", "md5"})
  ['blake2b', 'blake2s', 'sha224', 'sha256', 'sha384', 'sha3_224', 'sha3_256', 'sha3_384', 'sha3_512', 'sha512']

Each hash MUST be referenced by the canonical name of the hash, always lower case.

Hashes ``sha1`` and ``md5`` MUST NOT be present, respecting security
limitations of these hash algorithms. On the other hand, hash ``sha256`` SHOULD
be included.

Installers that cache installed distributions from an index SHOULD keep
information related to the cached distribution, so that
``provenance_url.json`` file can be created even when installing distributions
from installer's cache.

Examples
========

Examples of a valid provenance_url.json
---------------------------------------

A valid ``provenance_url.json`` stating multiple hashes:

.. code:: json

  {
    "archive_info": {
      "hashes": {
        "blake2s": "fffeaf3d0bd71dc960ca2113af890a2f2198f2466f8cd58ce4b77c1fc54601ff",
        "sha256": "236bcb61156d76c4b8a05821b988c7b8c35bf0da28a4b614e8d6ab5212c25c6f",
        "sha3_256": "c856930e0f707266d30e5b48c667a843d45e79bb30473c464e92dfa158285eab",
        "sha512": "6bad5536c30a0b2d5905318a1592948929fbac9baf3bcf2e7faeaf90f445f82bc2b656d0a89070d8a6a9395761f4793c83187bd640c64b2656a112b5be41f73d"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/07/51/2c0959c5adf988c44d9e1e0d940f5b074516ecc87e96b1af25f59de9ba38/pip-23.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"
  }

A valid ``provenance_url.json`` stating a single hash entry:

.. code:: json

  {
    "archive_info": {
      "hashes": {
        "sha256": "236bcb61156d76c4b8a05821b988c7b8c35bf0da28a4b614e8d6ab5212c25c6f"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/07/51/2c0959c5adf988c44d9e1e0d940f5b074516ecc87e96b1af25f59de9ba38/pip-23.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"
  }

A valid ``provenance_url.json`` stating a source distribution which was used to
build and install a wheel:

.. code:: json

  {
    "archive_info": {
      "hashes": {
        "sha256": "8bfe29f17c10e2f2e619de8033a07a224058d96b3bfe2ed61777596f7ffd7fa9"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/1d/43/ad8ae671de795ec2eafd86515ef9842ab68455009d864c058d0c3dcf680d/micropipenv-0.0.1.tar.gz"
  }

Examples of an invalid provenance_url.json
------------------------------------------

The following example includes ``hash`` key in the ``archive_info`` dictionary
as originally designed in :pep:`610` and the data structure documented in [3]_.
The ``hash`` key MUST NOT be present to prevent from any possible confusion
with ``hashes`` and additional checks that would be required to keep hash
values in sync.

.. code:: json

  {
    "archive_info": {
      "hash": "sha256=236bcb61156d76c4b8a05821b988c7b8c35bf0da28a4b614e8d6ab5212c25c6f",
      "hashes": {
        "sha256": "236bcb61156d76c4b8a05821b988c7b8c35bf0da28a4b614e8d6ab5212c25c6f"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/07/51/2c0959c5adf988c44d9e1e0d940f5b074516ecc87e96b1af25f59de9ba38/pip-23.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"
  }

Another example demonstrates an invalid hash name. The referenced hash does not
correspond to canonical hash name described in this PEP and `Python docs
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.hash.name>`__.

.. code:: json

  {
    "archive_info": {
      "hashes": {
        "SHA-256": "236bcb61156d76c4b8a05821b988c7b8c35bf0da28a4b614e8d6ab5212c25c6f"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/07/51/2c0959c5adf988c44d9e1e0d940f5b074516ecc87e96b1af25f59de9ba38/pip-23.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"
  }


Example pip commands and their effect on provenance_url.json and direct_url.json
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commands that generate a ``direct_url.json`` file but do not generate
```provenance_url.json`` file. These examples follow examples from :pep:`610`:

* ``pip install https://example.com/app-1.0.tgz``
* ``pip install https://example.com/app-1.0.whl``
* ``pip install “git+https://example.com/repo/app.git#egg=app&subdirectory=setup”``
* ``pip install ./app``
* ``pip install file:///home/user/app``
* ``pip install –editable "git+https://example.com/repo/app.git#egg=app&subdirectory=setup"`` (in which case, ``url`` will be the local directory where the git repository has been cloned to, and ``dir_info`` will be present with ``"editable": true`` and no ``vcs_info`` will be set)
* ``pip install -e ./app``

Commands that generate a ``provenance_url.json`` file but do not generate
``direct_url.json`` file:

* ``pip install app``
* ``pip install app~=2.2.0``
* ``pip install app –no-index –find-links "https://example.com/"``

This behaviour can be tested using changes to pip introduced in [1]_.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Naming the file direct_url.json instead of provenance_url.json
--------------------------------------------------------------

To preserve backwards compatibility with :pep:`610`, the file cannot be named
``direct_url.json`` (from :pep:`610`):

  This file MUST NOT be created when installing a distribution from an other
  type of requirement (i.e. name plus version specifier).

The change might introduce backwards compatibility issues for consumers of
``direct_url.json`` who rely on its presence only when distributions are
installed using a direct URL reference.

Deprecate direct_url.json and use only provenance_url.json
----------------------------------------------------------

File ``direct_url.json`` is already well established in :pep:`610` and is
already used by installers. For example, ``pip`` uses ``direct_url.json`` to
report a direct URL reference on ``pip freeze``. Deprecating
``direct_url.json`` would require additional changes to the ``pip freeze``
implementation in pip (see [2]_) and could introduce backwards compatibility
issues for already existing ``direct_url.json`` consumers.

Keeping the hash key in the archive_info dictionary
---------------------------------------------------

:pep:`610` and `its corresponding canonical PyPA spec
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/direct-url/>`__ discuss
the possibility to state ``hash`` key alongside the ``hashes`` key in the
``archive_info`` dictionary. This PEP explicitly discards the ``hash`` key in
the ``provenance_url.json`` file and expects only ``hashes`` key to be present.
By doing so we eliminate possible redundancy in the file, possible confusion,
and any additional checks that would need to be done to make sure hashes are in
sync.

Making the hashes field optional
--------------------------------

:pep:`610` and `its corresponding canonical PyPA spec
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/direct-url/>`__
recommend stating the ``hashes`` field of the ``archive_info`` in the
``direct_url.json`` file but allows ignoring it under certain circumstances
following :rfc:`2119`:

  A hashes key SHOULD be present as a dictionary mapping a hash name to a hex
  encoded digest of the file.

This PEP enforces availability of the ``hashes`` field of the ``archive_info``
in the ``provenance_url.json`` file if ``provenance_url.json`` file is created:

  The value of ``archive_info`` MUST be a dictionary with a single key
  ``hashes``.

By doing so, consumers of ``provenance_url.json`` file can perform check on
artifact digests when ``provenance_url.json`` file is created by installers.

Open Issues
===========

Availability of the provenance_url.json file in Conda
-----------------------------------------------------

We would like to get feedback on the ``provenance_url.json`` file by Conda
maintainers or developers. It is not clear whether Conda would like to adopt
the ``provenance_url.json`` file.

Using provenance_url.json in downstream installers
--------------------------------------------------

The proposed ``provenance_url.json`` file was meant to be adopted primarily by
Python installers. Other installers, such as apt or dnf, might record
provenance of the installed downstream Python distributions in their specific
way that can be specific to downstream package management. The proposed file is
not expected to be created by these downstream package installers and thus they
were intentionally left out of this PEP. However, any input by developers or
maintainers of these installers is valuable to possibly enrich the
``provenance_url.json`` file with information that would help in some way.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Since this PEP specifies a new file in the ``*.dist-info`` directory, there are
no backwards compatibility implications to consider in the ``provenance_url.json``
file itself. Also, this proposal does not make any changes to the
``direct_url.json`` described in :pep:`610` and `its corresponding canonical
PyPA spec
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/direct-url/>`__.

The content of ``provenance_url.json`` file was designed in a way to eventually
allow installers reuse some of the logic supporting :pep:`610` when a
direct URL refers to a source archive or a wheel.
